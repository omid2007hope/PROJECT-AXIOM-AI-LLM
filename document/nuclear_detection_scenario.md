# Nuclear Explosion Detection Scenario: Real-Time Multimodal Watchdog

## 1. Executive Overview

This operational scenario defines the architecture for utilizing **Project Axiom** as an open-source, real-time autonomous watchdog for detecting underground nuclear detonations. 

Underground nuclear testing detection relies fundamentally on the **Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) International Monitoring System (IMS)** framework, which bridges **seismic monitoring** (detecting kinetic blast dynamics) with **radionuclide monitoring** (verifying isotopic nuclear origin).

Project Axiom applies silicon-native C++23 streaming and CUDA tensor core compute to pivot open-source geophysical and orbital feeds into an automated detection and verification pipeline.

## 2. Recent Scientific & Mathematical Advancements

### 2.1 The 2024 Seismic Breakthrough: 99% Accuracy Statistical Modeling
Historically, differentiating underground nuclear detonations from natural tectonic earthquakes was limited by seismic source ambiguity, depth estimation errors, and complex geological propagation paths (e.g., North Korea’s 2017 test ambiguities).

* **Hypersphere Moment Tensor Projection:** In early 2024, researchers from the Australian National University (ANU) and Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) published a mathematical and statistical model that projects seismic moment tensors into a multi-dimensional hyperspherical manifold.
* **Separation Fidelity:** By projecting full-waveform data onto this hypersphere, the model distinguishes between isotropic expansion (explosions) and double-couple shearing (natural earthquakes) with **99% accuracy** using standard seismic station inputs.

### 2.2 Radionuclide Verification: Xenon International
Confirming a seismic event as nuclear—rather than a massive conventional chemical detonation—requires physical evidence of fission products:
* **Subsurface Gas Seepage:** Underground detonations fracture surrounding rock, causing noble fission gases to percolate through geological strata over hours and days into the lower atmosphere.
* **Beta-Gamma Coincidence Counting:** The **Xenon International** system, developed by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), provides next-generation automated radioxenon detection. It separates, enriches, and performs beta-gamma coincidence counting across key diagnostic isotopes:
  - $^{131\text{m}}\text{Xe}$ ($t_{1/2} \approx 11.9\text{ days}$)
  - $^{133}\text{Xe}$ ($t_{1/2} \approx 5.25\text{ days}$)
  - $^{133\text{m}}\text{Xe}$ ($t_{1/2} \approx 2.19\text{ days}$)
  - $^{135}\text{Xe}$ ($t_{1/2} \approx 9.14\text{ hours}$)
* **High Sensitivity:** Enables automated sampling cycles with ultra-trace sensitivity capable of identifying detonations thousands of kilometers downwind.

## 3. The Physics Barrier: Satellites Cannot Detect Underground Radiation

A common misconception is that earth observation or reconnaissance satellites can detect underground radiation directly. The laws of nuclear physics make orbital direct radiation sensing impossible:

1. **Matter Attenuation:** Prompt nuclear radiation (X-rays, gamma photons, neutrons) possesses high energy but attenuates rapidly through matter via the photoelectric effect, Compton scattering, pair production, and elastic collisions. While meters of lead or concrete arrest prompt radiation, hundreds of meters of dense geological rock (e.g., solid granite or basalt overburdens) completely absorb all prompt radiation.
2. **Orbital Sensor Profiles:** Space-based nuclear detection payloads—such as the US Space and Atmospheric Burst Reporting System (SABRS) aboard GPS constellations—are engineered strictly to detect optical flashes, X-rays, and gamma bursts produced by atmospheric or exoatmospheric detonations in space. They cannot penetrate the Earth's crust.
3. **Transport Latency:** Fission gases take days to percolate to the surface and are diluted in the planetary boundary layer, making them detectable only by ultrasensitive terrestrial sniffing stations (IMS radionuclide stations), not orbital optical/spectral satellites.

### 4.1 Stage 1: The Trigger (Continuous Global Seismic Waveforms)
* **Data Ingestion:** Axiom continuously consumes open seismic telemetry (e.g., IRIS / FDSN web services, miniSEED streaming).
* **Waveform Physics:**
  - *Tectonic Earthquakes:* Friction release across fault lines generates chaotic transverse shear waves ($S$-waves) and surface waves (Love and Rayleigh waves).
  - *Nuclear Detonations:* Point-source spherical expansion generates a sudden, highly compressed longitudinal primary wave ($P$-wave) with negligible primary shear energy.
* **Hypersphere Projection:** Pinned memory streams feed raw multi-axis velocity records into Axiom's CUDA tensor cores, computing moment tensor decomposition and projecting the source parameters into the hypersphere classification space.
* **Hypocenter Triangulation:** Upon positive trigger, station arrival differentials determine spatial latitude, longitude, and depth within seconds.

### 4.2 Stage 2: The Visual Proof (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar - InSAR)
* **Orbital SAR Feeds:** Axiom triggers an automated ingestion task for European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel-1 C-band SAR radar data covering the triangulated coordinates.
* **Surface Subsidence Measurement:** Following a contained underground test, the vaporized rock cavity cools, depressurizes, and collapses into a rubble chimney. The ground surface directly above sinks by millimeters to meters.
* **Interferogram Generation:** By computing phase differences between pre-event and post-event radar passes, Axiom renders differential interferograms. Concentric, rainbow-colored interference fringes pinpoint localized surface subsidence over the seismic hypocenter.

### 4.3 Stage 3: The Context (Optical and Thermal Earth Observation)
* **Multi-spectral Imagery:** Optical passes from Copernicus Sentinel-2 and commercial constellations are correlated over the target region.
* **Feature Detection:** Axiom runs convolutional feature extractors over high-resolution imagery to detect surface operational precursors:
  - New diagnostic cabling trailers and instrumentation trenches.
  - Tunnelling activity, fresh adit tailing dumps, and drilling equipment.
  - Surface security perimeters and vehicle tracks.

## 5. Strategic OSINT Impact & Applications

Historically, non-proliferation verification required human analysts at think tanks (such as CSIS, RUSI, or the Middlebury Institute of International Studies) to manually correlate seismic station alerts with satellite tasking and imagery analysis.

By combining:
1. Bare-metal, zero-overhead stream ingestion,
2. Real-time hyperspherical seismic classification, and
3. Automated satellite interferometry and optical pipeline dispatch,

Project Axiom provides an autonomous, tamper-proof, civilian open-source verification watchdog for global arms control and CTBT enforcement.
