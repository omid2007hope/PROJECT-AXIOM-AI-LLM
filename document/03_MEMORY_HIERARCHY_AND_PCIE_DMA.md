# 03. Memory Hierarchy and PCIe DMA

Achieving maximum compute throughput on modern graphics hardware requires an intimate understanding of physical memory topologies, cache architectures, and bus interfaces. Compute cores are capable of consuming data far faster than traditional memory interconnects can supply it. 

This document details how Project Axiom navigates the hardware memory hierarchy and leverages asynchronous Direct Memory Access (DMA) over the PCIe bus.

## 1. The Hardware Memory Hierarchy Pyramid

Data access latency increases by orders of magnitude as you move further away from the physical execution ALUs:

```
                  ▲               +-----------------------------------+
                 / \              |        CPU / GPU REGISTERS        |
                /   \             |    ~1 cycle latency | ~Bytes      |
               /     \            +-----------------------------------+
              /       \           |     L1 CACHE / SHARED MEMORY      |
             /  SPEED  \          |   ~10-30 cycles | ~Kilobytes      |
            /     vs    \         +-----------------------------------+
           /   CAPACITY  \        |             L2 CACHE              |
          /               \       |   ~50-200 cycles | ~Megabytes     |
         /                 \      +-----------------------------------+
        /                   \     |       GRAPHICS VRAM (GDDR6X)      |
       /                     \    |   ~200-400 cycles | 16-24 GB      |
      /                       \   +-----------------------------------+
     /                         \  |      HOST SYSTEM RAM (DDR5)       |
    /                           \ |  ~Microseconds (PCIe) | 64-128 GB |
   +-----------------------------++-----------------------------------+
```

- **GPU Registers:** The fastest storage on silicon. Sits inside the Streaming Multiprocessor (SM). Data manipulated here executes in a single clock cycle.
- **L1 Cache & Shared Memory (SRAM):** On-chip memory shared across threads within a thread block. Up to 128 KB per SM on Ada Lovelace (`sm_89`). Accessible in 10 to 30 clock cycles.
- **L2 Cache:** Chip-wide shared memory pool (e.g., 64 MB on the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080). Caches data across all SMs, running in ~150 to 200 cycles.
- **Device VRAM (GDDR6X):** Off-chip memory. Highly parallel bus width (256-bit on RTX 4080 yielding ~716 GB/s bandwidth), but requires 200 to 400 cycles of memory latency.
- **Host System RAM (via PCIe Bus):** Communicates across the PCIe Gen 4 x16 bus (~31.5 GB/s theoretical unidirectional limit). Accessing host RAM from the GPU introduces microsecond-scale latencies.

## 2. The Pageable Memory Hazard vs. Pinned DMA

In standard C++, dynamic data structures such as `std::vector` allocate memory on the pageable host heap:

```cpp
std::vector<uint32_t> context_window(128); // ALLOCATED IN PAGEABLE OS MEMORY
```

### The Operating System Paging Trap
The operating system reserves the authority to page out physical memory to the SSD whenever host memory pressure increases. If a GPU DMA hardware controller attempts to read physical RAM addresses directly while the OS is moving or swapping those pages, the GPU reads corrupted data or crashes the host kernel with a memory fault.

To protect system integrity, the NVIDIA CUDA driver detects pageable memory passed into `cudaMemcpyAsync()` and **silently degrades the call into a synchronous, blocking operation**. The CPU is halted while the CUDA driver copies the data into an internal pinned staging buffer before initiating the PCIe transfer. As a result, asynchronous streaming fails completely.

### The Axiom Solution: Persistent Pinned Memory
To enable true hardware DMA, memory buffers that cross the PCIe bus must be **page-locked (pinned)** via [`cudaHostAlloc()`](file:///c:/Users/Omid/X/Code/PROJECT-AXIOM/core/src/tensor_cores.cu):

```cpp
cudaError_t err = cudaHostAlloc(&host_ptr, byte_size, cudaHostAllocWriteCombined);
```

Page-locked memory informs the operating system kernel that the physical addresses are permanently fixed. The GPU's onboard DMA copy engines can now read the memory directly across the PCIe bus without waking or interrupting the host CPU.

## 3. Cache Bypassing & PCIe Token ID Bandwidth Inversion

A standard naive deep learning pipeline generates high-dimensional floating-point embeddings on the host CPU and streams large float arrays across the PCIe bus. For a 128-token context window with 32 dimensions, uploading floating-point vectors requires $128 \times 32 \times 2 = 8,192\text{ bytes}$ per step (or $16,384\text{ bytes}$ in FP32).

### The Inverted Token ID Dataflow
Project Axiom eliminates this bus bottleneck entirely by **inverting the embedding dataflow**:
1. **Host Uploads Compact Token IDs:** The CPU only uploads the 128 raw categorical `uint32_t` token IDs across the PCIe bus:
   $$128 \times 4\text{ bytes} = 512\text{ bytes per context window}$$
   This slashes PCIe bus utilization by **93.75%**.
2. **GPU VRAM Gather Kernel:** Once the 512-byte token array arrives in device memory via DMA, a branchless CUDA gather kernel (`gather_embeddings_kernel`) pulls the corresponding 32-dimensional vectors from the device embedding matrix `d_embedding_table` directly inside GDDR6X VRAM.
3. Because VRAM operates at over **432 GB/s to 716 GB/s** (compared to ~31.5 GB/s on PCIe Gen 4), embedding expansion occurs at native silicon speeds without ever choking the motherboard bus.

### The `cudaHostAllocWriteCombined` Optimization
In Project Axiom, the context window buffer is allocated with the `cudaHostAllocWriteCombined` flag:
- **Direct Write Buffering:** CPU writes bypass the L1/L2 caches entirely, landing directly in physical write-combining buffers that flush straight into the PCIe bus controller.
- **Zero Cache Pollution:** Host L1/L2 caches remain clear for critical application execution and tokenization logic.
- **Bandwidth Saturation:** Bypassing cache-line reads improves PCIe transfer throughput by up to **40%**, pushing host-to-device streaming toward the physical limits of the motherboard interconnect.

## 4. Multi-Stream Asynchronous Ping-Pong Architecture

Traditional GPU programming pipelines follow a synchronous stop-and-wait pattern:

```
[--- PCIe Transfer (Buffer A) ---] [--- GPU Compute (Buffer A) ---] [--- PCIe Transfer (Buffer B) ---]
```
The GPU compute cores sit completely idle while memory is transferring across the PCIe bus, and the PCIe bus sits completely idle while the compute cores are multiplying matrices.

### The Default Stream (Stream 0) Hazard
Submitting CUDA commands without explicitly designating a stream places them in the **Default Stream (Stream 0)**. Stream 0 acts as a global device synchronization barrier: no operation in Stream 0 can begin until all prior operations across all other streams have finished, and no operation in any other stream can begin until Stream 0 has completed.

### Dual Non-Blocking Streams
Axiom eradicates this synchronization barrier by creating two explicit non-blocking CUDA streams via [`cudaStreamCreateWithFlags()`](file:///c:/Users/Omid/X/Code/PROJECT-AXIOM/core/src/tensor_cores.cu):

```cpp
cudaStreamCreateWithFlags(&stream_compute, cudaStreamNonBlocking);
cudaStreamCreateWithFlags(&stream_transfer, cudaStreamNonBlocking);
```

Modern NVIDIA graphics cards feature independent hardware engines:
- **Dedicated DMA Copy Engines:** Physical hardware controllers specialized exclusively for bidirectional PCIe memory transfers.
- **Streaming Multiprocessors (SM):** Independent parallel computing engines equipped with Tensor Cores.

Because these engines are physically separate on silicon, Axiom overlaps them completely:

```
Stream 1 (Compute):   [====== Compute Batch 0 ======] [====== Compute Batch 1 ======]
Stream 2 (Transfer):  [== DMA Transfer Batch 1 =====] [== DMA Transfer Batch 2 =====]
                      |<---------------- Overlapped Execution --------------------->|
```

While Stream 1 executes CUTLASS Tensor Core matrix multiplications on Buffer A in VRAM, Stream 2 simultaneously transfers Buffer B across the PCIe bus. When Stream 1 finishes, the roles swap ("ping-pong"). The memory transfer latency is completely hidden behind computation, ensuring the GPU compute cores never starve.

## 5. Defensive Pointer Lifecycle State Machine

VRAM allocations are not managed by C++ standard library destructors. If a host C++ object goes out of scope without explicitly releasing GPU VRAM, the graphics driver retains the allocated memory indefinitely, inducing severe VRAM leakage.

Project Axiom enforces a rigid three-stage pointer safety lifecycle across all GPU operations:

```
               [Uninitialized] (ptr = nullptr)
                      │
                      │  cudaMalloc() / cudaHostAlloc()
                      ▼
               [Allocated] (Valid Physical VRAM / Pinned Address)
                      │
                      │  cudaFree() / cudaFreeHost()
                      ▼
               [Freed Pointer] (DANGEROUS: Dangling Reference)
                      │
                      │  ptr = nullptr (MANDATORY IMMEDIATE NEUTRALIZATION)
                      ▼
               [Safe Neutralized State] (ptr = nullptr)
```

1. **Null-Guard:** Before any memory manipulation, the pointer is checked for validity:
   ```cpp
   if (gpu->d_context_window) { ... }
   ```
2. **Hardware Deallocation:** The memory is released to the graphics driver:
   ```cpp
   cudaFree(gpu->d_context_window);
   ```
3. **Immediate Neutralization:** The pointer is reset to `nullptr` on the exact next line of code:
   ```cpp
   gpu->d_context_window = nullptr;
   ```

By neutralizing pointers immediately upon deallocation, duplicate free operations safely evaluate to no-ops (`cudaFree(nullptr)` is legally defined by the CUDA specification as a successful no-op), completely preventing double-free memory corruption and invalid pointer dereferencing.

## 6. Userspace BFC Caching Allocator & Stream-Ordered Pools

In high-throughput training loops, dynamic OS-level `cudaMalloc` calls introduce microsecond driver stalls that lock device page tables and serialize execution streams.

Axiom eradicates this bottleneck through two specialized memory managers:
1. **Userspace Best-Fit with Coalescing (`BfcAllocator`):**
   - Carves memory slices out of pre-allocated contiguous VRAM arenas in nanoseconds.
   - Merges adjacent free blocks immediately upon deallocation (neighbor coalescing), eradicating external fragmentation.
2. **Stream-Ordered Asynchronous Pools:**
   - Employs `cudaMallocAsync` and `cudaFreeAsync` for transient transfer buffers.
   - Guarantees exactly zero calls to blocking `cudaMalloc` during active training iterations.

## 7. Non-Blocking Telemetry & Event-Polled Synchronization

Traditional loss logging retrieves metrics via blocking `cudaMemcpy` or `cudaDeviceSynchronize()`, stalling the CPU and creating execution bubbles on the GPU timeline.

Axiom implements **Zero-Sync Loss Telemetry**:
1. **Dedicated Pinned Slot:** A 4-byte page-locked host buffer (`cudaHostAllocMapped`) receives loss asynchronously via `cudaMemcpyAsync`.
2. **Non-Blocking Polling:** Telemetry checks query completion via `cudaEventQuery(loss_event)`. If the event has not completed, compute continues uninterrupted on the GPU, achieving true non-blocking double-buffering.
